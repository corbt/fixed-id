            <Text>
              Long term, we expect many apps to natively support FixedID-based
              sign-in. Besides ensuring each user has only one account, FixedID
              sign-in is more private than centralized SSO providers like Google
              and Facebook. It's also more ergonomic than signing in with an
              Ethereum wallet directly, since FixedID has built-in in social
              recovery so you won't get locked out if you lose your private key.

            , which means they can be sent to other users or traded on
            exchanges. Many crypto wallets already have built-in support for
            sending FixedCoin. Long term, we'd also like to build dedicated apps
            for sending and receiving FixedCoin-denominated payments.

              What gives <FixedCoin /> value?
            </Heading>
            <Text>
              Bitcoin itself is a powerful example of the way shared ideas can
              conjure up value out of thin air, even without government backing.
              A currency issued through basic income could potentially be seen
              as more legitimate than Bitcoin itself, and eventually accrue more
              value. This is because if properly implemented it solves the
              critical social problem of fair distribution that Bitcoin is
              silent on.

            <Text>
              The FixedCoin issuance rate grows slowly by a set formula intended
              to double the total supply every 30 years (once a generation). So
              in the long term, the annual inflation in supply will settle at
              about <strong>2.3%</strong>. This is actually ideal for a currency
              meant to be spent, not hoardedâ€”many fiat currencies{' '}

            </Heading>
            <Text>
              Yes! The issuance rate of FixedCoin doesn't depend on the number
              of users in the system, so as more people sign up, each person
              will get fewer coins in each period. Early adopters will get
              rewarded with larger allocations of FixedCoin in the early days
              before more users sign up.

            <Text>
              Also, the FixedID contract issues ID numbers sequentially,
              starting with ID 1. So the sooner you sign up, the lower your
              number will be. And low numbers are cool. ðŸ˜Ž
